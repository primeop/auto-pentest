**Experimental project based on Automated Pentesting using Autopentest(DRL) developed by CROND - JAIST
**
AutoPentest-DRL is an automated penetration testing framework based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques. AutoPentest-DRL can determine the most appropriate attack path for a given logical network, and can also be used to execute a penetration testing attack on a real network via tools such as Nmap and Metasploit. This framework is intended for educational purposes, so that users can study the penetration testing attack mechanisms. 

An overview of AutoPentest-DRL is shown below. The framework receives user input regarding the logical target network, including vulnerability information; alternatively, the framework can use Nmap for network scanning to find actual vulnerabilities in a real target network with known topology. The MulVAL attack-graph generator is then used to determine potential attack trees, which are fed in a simplified form into the DRL engine. The attack path that is produced as output can be used to study the attack mechanisms on a large number of logical networks. Alternatively, the framework can use the attack path with penetration testing tools, such as Metasploit, making it possible for the user to study how the attack can be carried out on a real target network.
