 The tool operates on 2 modes : Logical attack & Real attack mode. Logical attack mode offers threat simulation, a feature that enables users to replicate attacks of a threat actor and test the boundaries of how far they have exploited a system or application. Real attack mode attacks the real world system witht the use of tools like Nmap and Metasploit after analysing the network topology.
